## Deployment

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gloridust/LocalChatLLM.git
cd ./LocalChatLLM
```

2. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) from its official website.

3. Install Python dependencies:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If any exceptions occur, try installing step by step to identify where the problem lies:

```python
pip install ollama
pip install pyaudio
pip install pydub
pip install ffmpeg
pip install pyttsx3
pip install openai-whisper
```

Refer to the official documentation of [Openai-Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper?tab=readme-ov-file#setup) for ffmpeg installation commands based on different systems:

```shell
# on Ubuntu or Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg

# on Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg

# on MacOS using Homebrew (https://brew.sh/)
brew install ffmpeg

# on Windows using Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/)
choco install ffmpeg

# on Windows using Scoop (https://scoop.sh/)
scoop install ffmpeg
```

If you encounter installation errors in the 'pip install' commands mentioned above, you may need to install the Rust development environment. Additionally, you might need to configure the PATH environment variable, such as 'export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"'. If the module named "setuptools_rust" is not found and installation fails, you need to install 'setuptools_rust' first:

```bash
pip install setuptools-rust
```

4. Pull the required olamma model and customize:

```bash
ollama pull gemma:7b
ollama create localchatllm-gemma-7b -f ./modelfile_en
```

5. Initialize and try running whisper:

```bash
whisper audio.wav --language English --model base
```

You're all set!

## Running

```bash
python ./start.py
```

The program records for 5 seconds and then waits to generate a response. After reading out the generated response, it will enter the recording state again, looping through this process.
